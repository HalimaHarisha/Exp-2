# Exp - 2 LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:
To study the problem statement, SRS document and draw all the UML diagrams of a Library Management System.

# SRS (Procedure):
# Step 1: 
Problem Identification Manual library operations like issuing, returning, and tracking books are time-consuming and prone to errors. The system aims to automate these processes.


# Step 2:

Requirement Analysis Identify user roles: Admin, Librarian, Student. Define main functions: Add books, issue/return books, search books, manage members, generate reports. Set non-functional needs: reliability, security, and easy interface.


# Step 3:

System Design Draw UML diagrams: Use Case, Class, Activity, Sequence, and Package diagrams. Design database tables for Books, Members, Transactions, and Staff.
